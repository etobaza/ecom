# Fault Tolerance

---

### Database Replication

To provide fault tolerance within the database layer, replication has been set up with the following configuration:

#### Primary-Replica Configuration

- **Primary Node:** Manages write operations.
- **Replica Nodes:** Handle read operations and serve as failover options if the primary node becomes unavailable.

### Application Layer

- **Load Balancer:** Distributes traffic across application instances to eliminate single points of failure.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Automatically adjusts the number of instances in response to traffic demands.

## Backup Strategies

### Regular Backups

- **Frequency:** Daily backups for critical data.
- **Storage:** Backups are maintained in both local and cloud storage to ensure redundancy.

### Backup Validation

- **Checksum Validation:** Confirms the integrity of backup files.
- **Restore Testing:** Periodically performs restore tests to ensure backup reliability.
